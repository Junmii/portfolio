                                    Since we and our friends go to the gym quite often, he came up with the idea to build an

                                    Werkenbijdrogisterij is a website my partner and I have build for my mother. She is a manager at an Etos store and needed a way to set a lower bar for hiring people.

                                <p>
                                    She came up with the idea for a website where the person looking for a job can leave their contact info without having to directly contact Etos themselves.

                                    Once again, my partner build the Back-End for this site and I designed and developed the Front-End.

                                    This is a small side project of mine that doesn't really have to do much with Front-End, but I'd still like to include it since it was my first personal Software Development project.
